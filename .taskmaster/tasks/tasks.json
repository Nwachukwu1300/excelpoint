Configure batch size based on available memory.\n<info added on 2025-07-08T20:46:05.935Z>\n✅ Successfully implemented batch processing for large materials\n\n## Implementation Details:\n\n### **Enhanced ContentProcessor Class:**\n\n**1. Dynamic Batch Size Calculation**\n- **Automatic memory-based sizing**: Calculates optimal batch size from available system memory\n- **Conservative memory estimation**: 2MB per chunk including overhead for embeddings and processing\n- **Smart limits**: Min 5 chunks, max 100 chunks per batch\n- **Memory-aware**: Uses ~50% of available memory for batch processing\n\n**2. Memory Monitoring & Management**\n- **Real-time memory tracking** using psutil library\n- **Configurable memory threshold** (default 80%) for triggering batch processing\n- **Intelligent decision logic**: Batch processing triggered by memory usage OR large chunk count\n- **Automatic garbage collection** when memory usage exceeds 85%\n- **GPU memory management**: Clears CUDA cache when available\n\n**3. Batch Processing Engine**\n- **`process_chunks_in_batches()`**: Memory-efficient processing with progress tracking\n- **`process_chunks_immediately()`**: Original behavior for small files\n- **Automatic mode selection**: Intelligently chooses based on chunk count and memory\n- **Progress callback support**: Real-time progress reporting capability\n\n### **System Integration:**\n\n**Updated Celery Tasks:**\n- **`process_material`**: Now uses ContentProcessor with 70% memory threshold for large files\n- **`generate_chunk_embedding`**: Uses single-chunk processing with 90% memory threshold\n\n### **Performance Benefits:**\n\n**📊 Memory Management**\n- ✅ **Prevents OOM errors** for large documents (100+ chunks)\n- ✅ **Dynamic resource allocation** based on available system memory  \n- ✅ **Automatic batch size optimization** (tested: 100 chunks with 0.93GB available memory)\n- ✅ **Memory monitoring** shows current usage (tested: 88.4% usage properly detected)\n\n**🚀 Processing Efficiency**\n- ✅ **Intelligent mode selection**: Automatically chooses batch vs immediate processing\n- ✅ **GPU optimization**: Automatic CUDA cache clearing for GPU-accelerated models\n- ✅ **Progress tracking**: Detailed logging per batch with memory usage monitoring\n- ✅ **Failure isolation**: Individual chunk failures don't stop batch processing\n\n### **Configuration Examples:**\n- **Large file processing**: `ContentProcessor(memory_threshold=0.7)` - 70% threshold\n- **Single chunk processing**: `ContentProcessor(batch_size=1, memory_threshold=0.9)` - 90% threshold\n- **Default processing**: `ContentProcessor()` - Auto-calculated batch size, 80% threshold\n\n**Memory Management Test Results:**\n- ✅ Properly calculated batch size: 100 chunks for 0.93GB available memory\n- ✅ Correct memory monitoring: Detected 88.4% current usage\n- ✅ Smart batch decision: Recommended batch processing for 50+ chunks\n\nReady for next subtask: Management command creation!\n</info added on 2025-07-08T20:46:05.935Z>",
