# Task ID: 12
# Title: Performance Optimization and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: low
# Description: Optimize system performance, implement monitoring, and ensure scalability for production deployment
# Details:
Implement database query optimization: add indexes on frequently queried fields, use select_related/prefetch_related for chat queries. Add Redis caching for frequently accessed embeddings and chat sessions using Django's cache framework. Implement API rate limiting using django-ratelimit (5 requests/minute per user). Add comprehensive logging using Python's logging module for chat interactions, errors, and performance metrics. Create monitoring dashboard using Django Admin or custom views to track: active sessions, message volume, response times, error rates. Implement database connection pooling and optimize Celery worker configuration. Add performance profiling with Django Debug Toolbar in development.

# Test Strategy:
Performance tests with load testing tools (locust). Database query analysis with Django Debug Toolbar. Cache hit rate monitoring. Load tests with concurrent users. Memory usage profiling for embedding operations.
