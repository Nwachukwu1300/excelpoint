# Task ID: 10
# Title: Fix Score Calculation NoneType Error for Dynamic Quiz Questions
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'points' error that occurs when calculating quiz scores for dynamic questions where answer.question is None.
# Details:
1. Root Cause Analysis and Error Handling:
   - Investigate the quiz scoring logic in views.py or scoring utilities to identify where the NoneType error occurs
   - Add null checks before accessing question.points attribute in score calculation functions
   - Implement defensive programming practices with proper exception handling using try-catch blocks
   - Add logging to track when and why answer.question becomes None during quiz processing

2. Database Relationship Validation:
   - Review the UserAnswer model to ensure proper foreign key relationships with Question model
   - Add database constraints and validation to prevent orphaned UserAnswer records without valid question references
   - Implement cascade delete rules to maintain data integrity when questions are removed
   - Add migration scripts to clean up existing orphaned records if any exist

3. Score Calculation Logic Enhancement:
   - Refactor the scoring algorithm to handle edge cases where questions might be None or deleted
   - Implement fallback scoring mechanisms for dynamic questions that may have been modified or removed
   - Add validation to ensure all questions in a quiz have valid point values before score calculation
   - Create a robust scoring service that can handle partial quiz submissions and missing question data

4. Dynamic Question Management:
   - Review the dynamic question generation process to ensure questions are properly persisted before user interaction
   - Implement proper lifecycle management for dynamically generated questions
   - Add cleanup mechanisms for temporary or expired dynamic questions
   - Ensure consistent question state throughout the quiz-taking process

5. Error Recovery and User Experience:
   - Implement graceful error handling that doesn't break the quiz submission flow
   - Add user-friendly error messages when scoring issues occur
   - Create fallback mechanisms to allow quiz completion even with problematic questions
   - Implement retry logic for transient scoring errors

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create test cases that simulate UserAnswer objects with None question references
   - Test score calculation functions with various edge cases including missing questions, zero points, and invalid data
   - Verify that null checks and exception handling work correctly
   - Test database constraint validation and foreign key relationships

2. Integration Testing:
   - Create end-to-end tests that simulate the complete quiz flow from question generation to score calculation
   - Test quiz submission with dynamically generated questions that are subsequently deleted or modified
   - Verify that scoring works correctly with mixed static and dynamic questions
   - Test concurrent quiz submissions to ensure thread safety in scoring logic

3. Error Simulation Testing:
   - Manually create database scenarios with orphaned UserAnswer records
   - Test system behavior when questions are deleted mid-quiz
   - Simulate network interruptions during quiz submission to test error recovery
   - Verify that all error conditions are properly logged and handled

4. Performance and Load Testing:
   - Test scoring performance with large numbers of questions and answers
   - Verify that database queries for score calculation are optimized
   - Test system behavior under high concurrent quiz submission load
   - Monitor memory usage during score calculation for large quizzes

5. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Conduct manual testing of the complete quiz-taking experience
   - Verify that users receive appropriate feedback when scoring issues occur
   - Test that quiz results are displayed correctly even with problematic questions
   - Ensure that the user experience remains smooth despite backend error handling
