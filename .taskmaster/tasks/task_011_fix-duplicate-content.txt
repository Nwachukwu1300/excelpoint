# Task ID: 11
# Title: Add Quiz Past Results Display to Subject Materials Section
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement functionality to display quiz past results in the subject materials section by debugging and fixing the existing code that prevents results from showing.
# Details:
1. Investigation and Root Cause Analysis:
   - Review the existing quiz results display code in templates and views to identify why results aren't showing
   - Check the database queries for retrieving quiz results and verify they're returning data correctly
   - Examine the template rendering logic to ensure quiz results are being passed to the frontend
   - Investigate potential issues with user authentication/authorization affecting results visibility

2. Frontend Display Implementation:
   - Fix or enhance the existing HTML/CSS templates for displaying quiz results in the subject materials section
   - Implement proper data binding between backend quiz results and frontend display components
   - Add responsive design considerations for different screen sizes
   - Ensure proper formatting of quiz scores, dates, and attempt counts

3. Backend Query Optimization:
   - Review and optimize database queries for fetching quiz results related to specific subjects
   - Implement proper filtering to show only relevant quiz results for the current user and subject
   - Add pagination or limiting mechanisms if there are many quiz attempts
   - Ensure proper ordering of results (most recent first, highest scores, etc.)

4. Data Validation and Error Handling:
   - Add proper error handling for cases where no quiz results exist
   - Implement fallback displays for empty states
   - Validate that quiz results are properly associated with the correct subject materials
   - Add logging to track when results are successfully retrieved and displayed

5. Integration with Existing Quiz System:
   - Ensure compatibility with the fixed quiz submission and scoring systems from previous tasks
   - Verify that newly submitted quiz results appear correctly in the display
   - Test integration with the subject materials navigation and layout

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create unit tests for quiz results retrieval functions to verify correct data fetching
   - Test template rendering with various quiz result datasets (empty, single result, multiple results)
   - Verify database query functions return expected result formats
   - Test error handling for edge cases like missing quiz data or invalid user permissions

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test the complete flow from quiz submission to results display in the subject materials section
   - Verify that quiz results are properly filtered by subject and user
   - Test the display functionality with different user roles and permissions
   - Ensure proper integration with existing subject materials navigation

3. Frontend Testing:
   - Manually test the quiz results display across different browsers and screen sizes
   - Verify that all quiz result data (scores, dates, attempts) is displayed correctly
   - Test responsive design and layout consistency within the subject materials section
   - Validate that empty states and error messages display appropriately

4. End-to-End Testing:
   - Complete a full user journey: take a quiz, submit it, and verify results appear in subject materials
   - Test with multiple quiz attempts to ensure all results are displayed correctly
   - Verify that results update in real-time after new quiz submissions
   - Test with different subjects to ensure proper data isolation and display
