# Task ID: 10
# Title: Add Conversation Context and Memory
# Status: completed
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance RAG pipeline to maintain conversation context and improve response relevance - COMPLETED with follow-up request detection and enhanced system prompts
# Details:
SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED: Conversation memory system with follow-up request detection, enhanced system prompts for context handling, and improved validation logic. The system now properly handles length modifications, format requests, clarification requests, and context references. Follow-up requests bypass content grounding validation while maintaining safety checks. All test scenarios pass with 100% success rate.

# Test Strategy:
COMPLETED: All validation tests passed including length modification requests, direct modification commands, clarification requests, detail requests, and proper handling of new academic questions. Live testing confirmed proper shortened response generation for DDL questions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Follow-up Request Detection [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create _is_followup_request method to detect various types of follow-up requests
### Details:
Implemented detection for length modifications (shorter, longer, more detail, brief), format requests (respond differently, make it clearer), clarification requests (clarify, what do you mean), and context references (that, it, your response)

## 2. Enhance System Prompt for Context Handling [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update system prompt with explicit instructions for conversation context and follow-up processing
### Details:
Added clear guidance for follow-up request processing, distinction between conversational/academic/follow-up queries, and instructions to modify previous responses appropriately

## 3. Improve Validation Logic for Follow-ups [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify validation to handle follow-up requests appropriately
### Details:
Follow-up requests now bypass content grounding validation, use moderate validation (prohibited patterns check only), allow modification of previous material-based responses, and pass chat history to validation for context awareness

## 4. Comprehensive Testing and Validation [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test all conversation memory scenarios and validate functionality
### Details:
Completed testing of 7 scenarios with 100% success rate: length modification, direct modification, clarification, detail requests, new academic questions, and live DDL question testing
