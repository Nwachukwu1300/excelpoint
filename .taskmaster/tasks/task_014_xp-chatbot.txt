# Title: Update XP Chatbot UI and Messaging for Subject-Specific Assistant Role
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update all user-facing text, welcome messages, error messages, and help content to reflect XP as a subject-based assistant that only uses uploaded materials, not a general AI assistant.
# Details:
1. Update Welcome Messages:
   a. Replace generic greetings with subject-specific ones: "Hi! I can help you review this subject using the materials you've uploaded."
   b. Add contextual welcome messages based on material availability: "I'm ready to answer questions about your uploaded materials" vs "Please upload materials first to get started"
   c. Include material count in welcome: "I have access to X documents/materials for this subject"

2. Update Error Messages:
   a. Replace generic "I don't know" with material-specific responses: "I couldn't find information about that in your uploaded materials"
   b. Update connection errors: "Unable to access your uploaded materials right now"
   c. Add specific guidance: "Try rephrasing your question or check if this topic is covered in your materials"

3. Update Help Text and Tooltips:
   a. Replace general AI capabilities with material-only descriptions
   b. Add explanatory text: "XP only uses information from materials you've uploaded for this subject"
   c. Update placeholder text in chat input: "Ask about your uploaded materials..."
   d. Add help section explaining XP's limitations and capabilities

4. Update UI Components:
   a. Modify ChatInterface component to show material-aware status indicators
   b. Update empty state messages to guide users to upload materials
   c. Add material reference indicators in chat responses
   d. Update loading states to mention "searching your materials..."

5. Create Consistent Messaging System:
   a. Create constants file for all user-facing messages
   b. Implement message templates that can be customized per subject
   c. Add internationalization support for future localization

# Test Strategy:
1. UI Component Tests:
   a. Test welcome message variations with different material states (no materials, some materials, many materials)
   b. Verify error messages display correctly for various failure scenarios
   c. Test help text and tooltips render with updated content

2. Integration Tests:
   a. Test complete user flow from empty state to active chat with updated messaging
   b. Verify message consistency across different chat states and error conditions
   c. Test that all references to general AI capabilities are removed

3. User Experience Tests:
   a. Conduct user testing to ensure messaging clearly communicates XP's material-only capabilities
   b. Test that users understand the difference between XP and general AI assistants
   c. Verify error messages provide helpful guidance for users

4. Accessibility Tests:
   a. Test screen reader compatibility with updated messaging
   b. Verify proper ARIA labels and descriptions reflect the subject-specific role
   c. Test keyboard navigation with updated help text

5. Cross-browser and Device Tests:
   a. Test message display across different screen sizes and devices
   b. Verify text truncation and wrapping works properly with longer subject-specific messages
