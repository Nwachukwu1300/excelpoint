# Task ID: 5
# Title: Enhance Logging and Debugging Capabilities
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive logging and debugging features to track content flow and aid in issue resolution.
# Details:
1. Implement structured logging using structlog (version 23.1.0):
   - Include material ID, user ID, and operation type in all logs
   - Use log levels appropriately (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
2. Integrate with a centralized logging service like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Datadog:
   - Use the appropriate Python client library (e.g., elasticsearch-py 7.17.9 for ELK)
3. Implement distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry (version 1.18.0):
   - Instrument key functions to track the flow of operations across services
4. Create custom exceptions for specific error scenarios.
5. Implement a debug mode toggle using environment variables.
6. Add performance profiling using cProfile and visualize with SnakeViz (version 2.2.0).

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit tests to verify log output format and content.
2. Implement integration tests to check end-to-end logging flow.
3. Manually review logs in the centralized logging service to ensure proper aggregation.
4. Use synthetic transactions to test distributed tracing.
5. Verify that debug mode correctly toggles verbose logging.
6. Run performance tests and analyze profiling results.
