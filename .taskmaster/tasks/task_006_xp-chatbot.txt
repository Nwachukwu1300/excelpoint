# Task ID: 6
# Title: Build Chat Widget Frontend Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create responsive React chat widget component with modern UI design for subject detail pages
# Details:
Create ChatWidget React component using modern hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext). Implement three states: collapsed bubble (fixed bottom-right), expanded panel (400px width), full conversation view. Use CSS modules or styled-components for styling. Include components: ChatBubble (collapsed state), ChatPanel (expanded), MessageList, MessageInput, TypingIndicator. Use React Query v4 for API state management and caching. Implement auto-scroll to bottom, message timestamps, and loading states. Style with modern chat UI patterns: user messages right-aligned (blue), assistant messages left-aligned (gray), proper spacing and typography. Make responsive with CSS Grid/Flexbox for mobile compatibility.

# Test Strategy:
Component unit tests using React Testing Library. Visual regression tests with different screen sizes. User interaction tests for state transitions. Accessibility tests for keyboard navigation and screen readers.

# Subtasks:

‚úÖ Successfully set up React project structure and dependencies

## Implementation Details:

### **Package Configuration:**
- **Updated package.json** with React 18, React Query v4, TypeScript, Vite, and testing dependencies
- **Styled Components** for CSS-in-JS styling approach
- **Axios** for HTTP requests with Django backend
- **Lucide React** for modern icons
- **Testing suite** with Vitest, React Testing Library, and jsdom

### **Build System & Configuration:**
- **Vite configuration** (`vite.config.ts`) for fast development and optimized builds
- **Output configured** to Django's `static/js/` directory for seamless integration
- **TypeScript configuration** (`tsconfig.json`) with path mapping and strict mode
- **Vitest configuration** (`vitest.config.ts`) for component testing

### **Project Structure Created:**
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/chat/    # Chat widget components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/             # Custom React hooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/          # API service layer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/             # TypeScript type definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test/              # Test utilities and setup
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tsx           # Entry point for chat widget
```

### **Core Infrastructure:**
- **TypeScript types** (`src/types/chat.ts`) matching Django API models
- **API service layer** (`src/services/chatApi.ts`) with axios, CSRF protection, and error handling
- **React Query** configured for caching and state management
- **Main entry point** (`src/main.tsx`) for DOM integration with Django templates

### **Integration Strategy:**
- **DOM-based initialization** - widget looks for `#chat-widget-root` element
- **Subject ID passed** via data attributes from Django templates
- **CSRF token handling** for Django security requirements
- **Builds to static/js/** for Django's static file serving

Next: Create the core chat UI components (ChatBubble, ChatPanel, MessageList, etc.)
