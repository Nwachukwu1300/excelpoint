# Task ID: 8
# Title: Conduct System-wide Testing and Documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Perform comprehensive testing of the entire system and update documentation to reflect all changes.
# Details:
1. Design and implement end-to-end tests using Selenium (version 4.10.0) or Playwright (version 1.35.1) to simulate user interactions:
   - Test the entire flow from material upload to flashcard/quiz generation
2. Conduct security testing:
   - Use bandit (version 1.7.5) for static code analysis
   - Implement penetration testing focusing on data isolation
3. Perform load testing using Locust (version 2.15.1) to ensure system stability under high load.
4. Update all documentation:
   - Use Sphinx (version 7.0.1) to generate API documentation
   - Update README and installation instructions
   - Create a troubleshooting guide for common issues
5. Implement monitoring and alerting:
   - Set up Prometheus (version 2.44.0) and Grafana (version 9.5.2) for system monitoring
   - Configure alerts for abnormal behavior or errors
6. Conduct a final code review and refactoring pass to ensure code quality and adherence to PEP 8 standards.

# Test Strategy:
1. Run all implemented tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) and verify passing status.
2. Manually review generated documentation for completeness and clarity.
3. Conduct a series of load tests with gradually increasing load to determine system limits.
4. Perform manual testing of the entire system flow with various types of materials.
5. Review monitoring dashboards and intentionally trigger alerts to verify proper functionality.
6. Conduct a team code review session to catch any remaining issues or potential improvements.
