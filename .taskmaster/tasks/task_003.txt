# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement RAG Pipeline Service
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive RAG service that combines vector search with OpenAI API for context-aware responses
# Details:
Create RAGService class that orchestrates: 1) Query embedding generation using existing sentence transformer, 2) Vector search via VectorSearchService, 3) Context assembly from retrieved chunks, 4) OpenAI API call with system prompt and context. Implement generate_response(query, subject_id, chat_history=[]) method. Use existing OpenAI client from subjects/llm_utils.py with GPT-3.5-turbo. Create system prompt template: 'You are XP, an AI assistant that helps users understand their uploaded materials. Only answer based on the provided context. If the question is outside the context, respond with: I can only help with the materials uploaded under this subject.' Include conversation history for context continuity.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for each pipeline component. Integration tests with mock OpenAI responses. End-to-end tests with real subject materials to verify response quality and scope limitation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create RAGService Class [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core RAGService class that orchestrates vector search with OpenAI API calls
### Details:
Create RAGService class in subjects/services/rag_service.py with methods: generate_response(query, subject_id, chat_history=[]), _prepare_context(), _format_chat_history(), _validate_response(). Integrate VectorSearchService and existing OpenAI client from llm_utils.py. Include proper error handling and logging.

## 2. Implement Context Assembly [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create intelligent context assembly from retrieved chunks with proper formatting and size management
### Details:
Implement _prepare_context() method that takes search results and assembles them into coherent context for the LLM. Include chunk ranking, deduplication, context size management (stay within token limits), and source attribution. Format context for optimal LLM comprehension.

## 3. Implement System Prompts and Templates [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create XP-specific system prompts and response templates for consistent chatbot behavior
### Details:
Design system prompt template for XP that enforces subject-only responses, maintains helpful personality, and handles out-of-scope queries gracefully. Include conversation history formatting, context injection templates, and fallback responses for edge cases. Test prompt effectiveness with various query types.

## 4. Test RAG Pipeline [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Create comprehensive tests for the RAG pipeline including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end scenarios
### Details:
Write unit tests for RAGService methods with mock dependencies. Create integration tests with real VectorSearchService and mock OpenAI responses. Add end-to-end tests with actual subject materials to verify response quality, scope limitation, and chat history handling. Test edge cases like empty queries, no search results, and API failures.
