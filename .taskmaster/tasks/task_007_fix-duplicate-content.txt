# Task ID: 7
# Title: Refactor Flashcard and Quiz Generation Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Restructure the generation pipeline to incorporate all the implemented fixes and improvements.
# Details:
1. Refactor the flashcard and quiz generation functions in tasks.py and llm_utils.py:
   - Implement the Command pattern for different generation strategies
   - Use dependency injection for better testability
2. Integrate all previous fixes:
   - Content extraction verification
   - Enhanced AI prompt generation
   - Optimized database queries
   - Improved caching mechanisms
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Content isolation and validation
3. Implement retry mechanisms using tenacity for resilience against transient failures.
4. Use asyncio and aiohttp (version 3.8.4) for concurrent API calls to improve performance.
5. Implement a circuit breaker pattern using CircuitBreaker (version 1.4.0) to handle downstream service failures gracefully.
6. Add detailed type hints and use mypy (version 1.3.0) for static type checking.

# Test Strategy:
1. Implement unit tests for each component of the refactored pipeline.
2. Create integration tests that verify the entire generation process end-to-end.
3. Implement property-based tests to ensure correct behavior with various input types.
4. Perform load testing to verify pipeline performance under stress.
5. Conduct manual testing with a diverse set of materials to ensure correct and unique generation.
6. Use code coverage tools (e.g., coverage.py 7.2.7) to ensure comprehensive test coverage.
