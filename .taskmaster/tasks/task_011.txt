# Priority: low
# Description: Add enhanced UX features including material citations, suggested questions, and typing indicators
# Details:
Add material citations to responses by tracking which ContentChunks were used and including source references: 'According to your uploaded document "{material_name}"...'. Implement suggested follow-up questions by analyzing conversation context and generating 3 relevant questions using OpenAI API. Add typing indicator with WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for real-time feedback. Create message reactions (thumbs up/down) for response quality feedback. Implement conversation search functionality using full-text search on message content. Add export conversation feature generating PDF or text file. Use React Suspense for lazy loading of advanced features.

# Test Strategy:
Feature tests for citations and suggested questions. Real-time functionality tests for typing indicators. User experience tests for search and export features. Performance tests for advanced features impact.
