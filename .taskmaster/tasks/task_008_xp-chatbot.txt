# Title: Integrate Chat Widget with Subject Detail Page
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Seamlessly integrate the chat widget into existing subject detail pages with proper initialization
# Details:
Modify existing subject detail template to include chat widget. Create ChatWidgetContainer component that initializes with subject_id from URL params. Use Django's JSON script filter to pass subject data to frontend. Ensure widget only appears on individual subject pages, not subject list pages. Implement lazy loading to avoid impacting page load performance. Add proper error boundaries and fallback UI. Use existing authentication context to pass user data. Ensure widget doesn't interfere with existing page functionality. Add CSS to ensure widget stays fixed during page scroll.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests on subject detail pages. Cross-browser testing for widget positioning. Mobile responsiveness tests. Performance tests to ensure no impact on page load times.
