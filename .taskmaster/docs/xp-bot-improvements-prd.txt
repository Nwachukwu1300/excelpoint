# RAG-Based XP Bot Enhancement Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Enhance the existing XP chatbot system to strictly enforce material-only responses, improve user experience, and ensure proper subject scoping. The bot must function as a subject-specific assistant trained exclusively on user-uploaded materials.

## Current State Analysis
- ✅ Basic RAG pipeline implemented with vector search
- ✅ Content chunk processing and embedding generation 
- ✅ OpenAI integration for response generation
- ❌ Bot still provides general knowledge responses outside uploaded materials
- ❌ UI messaging suggests general AI assistant rather than material-specific helper
- ❌ No proper session memory implementation
- ❌ Insufficient enforcement of material-only responses

## Core Requirements

### 1. Strict Material-Only Response Enforcement
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Description:** XP must ONLY answer using subject-uploaded materials. No fallback to general knowledge.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- When vector retrieval returns no relevant chunks above threshold, XP responds with helpful message about insufficient material
- LLM system prompt explicitly prohibits general knowledge responses
- Response validation rejects any answer that goes beyond provided context
- Comprehensive testing shows zero general knowledge leakage

### 2. Enhanced RAG and Vector Search System
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Description:** Optimize the existing RAG pipeline for better material binding and retrieval accuracy.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Vector search scoped strictly to user + subject combination
- Improved similarity thresholds based on content analysis
- Better chunk context preparation with source attribution
- Enhanced relevance scoring and filtering

### 3. Subject-Scoped Material Binding
**Priority:** HIGH
**Description:** Ensure XP operates within strict subject boundaries with no cross-contamination.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Vector index built only from materials uploaded under the current subject
- No access to materials from other subjects or users
- Clear subject identification in all queries and responses
- Audit trail for material access patterns

### 4. Session Memory Implementation
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Description:** XP should remember past conversations within the same subject and provide continuity.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Chat history preserved per user per subject
- Context from previous messages influences current responses
- Memory stays scoped to the same subject only
- Session management with proper cleanup

### 5. Subject-Specific UI and Messaging
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Description:** Update all user-facing text to reflect XP as a subject-based assistant, not general AI.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Welcome message: "Hi! I can help you review this subject using the materials you've uploaded."
- Error messages specifically mention uploaded materials
- UI elements reflect material-based nature
- Help text explains XP's material-only capabilities

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Django with existing RAG service
- **Vector Search:** Current sentence-transformers implementation
- **LLM:** OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo with enhanced prompting
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for session storage
- **Frontend:** React components for chat interface

### System Architecture
- Enhanced RAG service with stricter validation
- Improved prompt engineering for material-only responses
- Session management service for chat continuity
- Subject-scoped vector indexing
- Response validation layer

### Performance Requirements
- Response time: < 3 seconds for typical queries
- Memory usage: Efficient handling of chat history
- Scalability: Support multiple concurrent subject sessions
- Reliability: 99.9% uptime for chat functionality

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Response Enforcement (Week 1)
Focus on preventing general knowledge responses and improving material binding.

### Phase 2: UI and Messaging Updates (Week 1) 
Update all user-facing elements to reflect subject-specific nature.

### Phase 3: Enhanced RAG Pipeline (Week 2)
Optimize vector search and improve retrieval accuracy.

### Phase 4: Session Memory System (Week 2)
Implement proper chat history and session management.

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation (Week 3)
Comprehensive testing to ensure all requirements are met.

## Success Metrics
- 100% material-only responses (zero general knowledge leakage)
- User satisfaction with subject-specific assistance
- Improved response relevance scores
- Successful session continuity across conversations
- Clear understanding of XP's role and capabilities

## Risk Mitigation
- Comprehensive testing prevents general knowledge responses
- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- Monitoring and alerting for response quality
- Fallback mechanisms for edge cases

## Dependencies
- OpenAI API access for LLM responses
- Existing content processing pipeline
- User authentication system
- Subject material upload functionality
