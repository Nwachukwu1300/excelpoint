# AWS S3 Integration for ExcelPoint - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Integrate AWS S3 cloud storage into the ExcelPoint Django application to replace local file storage for user-uploaded materials. This will provide scalable, reliable, and secure file storage for the learning platform.

## Current State
- Files are currently stored locally using Django's default FileField
- SubjectMaterial model stores files in local media directory
- UserProfile avatar images stored locally
- File processing tasks access files via local file paths
- No cloud storage integration exists

## Target State
- All user-uploaded files stored in AWS S3
- Seamless transition from local to cloud storage
- Maintain existing functionality while improving scalability
- Support for both development (local) and production (S3) environments
- Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Storage Abstraction Layer
- Create abstract storage service interface
- Implement local storage service (existing functionality)
- Implement S3 storage service (new functionality)
- Factory pattern for switching between storage backends
- Environment-based configuration

### 2. Django Integration
- Install and configure django-storages
- Update Django settings for S3 configuration
- Modify models to use storage abstraction
- Update file upload views and forms
- Ensure proper URL generation for S3 files

### 3. File Processing Updates
- Update Celery tasks to work with S3 files
- Modify ContentProcessor to handle S3 file paths
- Update transcription service for S3 files
- Ensure background tasks can access S3 files

### 4. Model Updates
- Update SubjectMaterial model for S3 compatibility
- Update UserProfile model for avatar storage
- Add storage service integration to models
- Maintain backward compatibility

### 5. URL and Media Handling
- Configure S3 URLs for file access
- Update static and media file serving
- Handle file permissions and access control
- Implement proper file URL generation

### 6. Migration Strategy
- Create migration script for existing files
- Implement gradual migration approach
- Maintain data integrity during transition
- Provide rollback capabilities

### 7. Testing and Validation
- Unit tests for storage services
- Integration tests for file upload/download
- Test file processing with S3 files
- Validate all existing functionality works

### 8. Error Handling and Monitoring
- Implement proper error handling for S3 operations
- Add logging for storage operations
- Monitor S3 usage and costs
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations

## Success Criteria
- All file uploads work seamlessly with S3
- Existing files can be migrated to S3
- File processing tasks work with S3 files
- Application performance is maintained or improved
- Cost-effective S3 usage
- Proper error handling and monitoring

## Dependencies
- AWS S3 bucket already created and configured
- IAM user with proper S3 permissions
- django-storages package
- boto3 package for AWS SDK
- Existing file processing infrastructure

## Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Minimal downtime during migration
- Cost-effective S3 usage
- Secure file access and storage
- Support for existing file formats and sizes

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Storage abstraction layer (1-2 days)
- Phase 2: Django integration (1-2 days)
- Phase 3: File processing updates (1-2 days)
- Phase 4: Testing and validation (1 day)
- Phase 5: Migration and deployment (1 day)

## Risk Mitigation
- Implement gradual migration approach
- Maintain local storage as fallback
- Comprehensive testing before production deployment
- Monitor S3 costs and usage
- Implement proper error handling and logging
