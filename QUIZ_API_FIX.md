# Quiz API Key Fix - Documentation

## Problem Solved
The ExcelPoint learning platform's dynamic quiz generation was failing with 401 authentication errors due to incorrect OpenAI API key configuration.

## Root Cause
The OpenAI client was being initialized at the module level in `subjects/tasks.py` and `subjects/llm_utils.py`, which caused issues with Django settings loading and API key configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed OpenAI Client Initialization
- **File**: `subjects/tasks.py`
- **Change**: Removed global client initialization and created client dynamically in `_call_openai_api()` function
- **Impact**: Ensures fresh settings are loaded for each API call

### 2. Fixed OpenAI Client in LLM Utils
- **File**: `subjects/llm_utils.py`
- **Change**: Removed global client initialization and created client dynamically in all functions
- **Impact**: Ensures consistent API key usage across all LLM functions

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- **File**: `subjects/views.py`
- **Change**: Added fallback to static questions when API fails
- **Impact**: Users can still take quizzes even if dynamic generation fails

## Testing

### API Connection Test
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python test_quiz_api.py
```

### Manual Testing
1. Start the Django server: `python manage.py runserver`
2. Navigate to a subject with uploaded materials
3. Try to take a quiz with dynamic questions enabled
4. Verify that questions are generated successfully

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
Make sure your `.env` file contains:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_valid_openai_api_key_here
```

### Verification
Test that the API key is loaded correctly:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py shell -c "from django.conf import settings; print('API Key loaded:', 'Yes' if settings.OPENAI_API_KEY else 'No')"
```

## Error Handling Improvements

### Fallback Mechanism
- If dynamic question generation fails, the system now falls back to static questions
- Users see a warning message but can still take the quiz
- If no static questions exist, users are redirected with an error message

### User Experience
- Clear error messages for users
- Graceful degradation when API is unavailable
- No disruption to existing static quiz functionality

## Files Modified

1. **subjects/tasks.py**
   - Removed global OpenAI client
   - Added dynamic client creation in `_call_openai_api()`

2. **subjects/llm_utils.py**
   - Removed global OpenAI client
   - Added dynamic client creation in all functions

3. **subjects/views.py**
   - Enhanced error handling in `take_quiz()` view
   - Added fallback to static questions
   - Added user-friendly error messages

## Verification Steps

1. **Check API Key Loading**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py shell -c "from django.conf import settings; print(settings.OPENAI_API_KEY[:20] + '...')"
   ```

2. **Test API Connection**:
   ```bash
   python test_quiz_api.py
   ```

3. **Test Quiz Functionality**:
   - Upload a document to a subject
   - Try taking a quiz with dynamic questions
   - Verify questions are generated

## Troubleshooting

### If API Still Fails
1. Check that `.env` file exists and contains valid API key
2. Verify API key has sufficient credits
3. Check network connectivity
4. Review Django logs for detailed error messages

### If Questions Don't Generate
1. Ensure subject has uploaded materials
2. Check that materials have been processed (status = 'COMPLETED')
3. Verify Celery worker is running for background tasks

## Success Criteria
- ✅ API connection working
- ✅ Dynamic question generation functional
- ✅ Fallback to static questions when API fails
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ No disruption to existing functionality
